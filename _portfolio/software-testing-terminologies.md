* Testing:
The process of evaluating software to identify bugs, ensure functionality, and validate that it meets the requirements.

* Functional Testing:
Testing the application's features and functionality to ensure they work as intended based on requirements.

* Smoke Testing:
A preliminary test to check whether the core functionalities of a build work before proceeding with detailed testing.

* Sanity Testing:
A focused testing approach to verify that specific functionality or bug fixes are working correctly.

* Regression Testing:
Re-testing the application to ensure that recent changes have not introduced new defects in existing functionality.

* Integration Testing:
Testing the interaction between different modules or components of the application to ensure seamless integration.

* Monkey Testing:
Random testing performed without specific test cases to check for crashes or unexpected behavior.

* Gorilla Testing:
Intensive testing of a single module or feature to ensure robustness and stability.

* Automation Testing:
The process of using tools and scripts to execute test cases automatically, saving time and effort.

* Database Testing:
Testing the database for data integrity, schema validation, performance, and security.

* GUI Testing:
Testing the graphical user interface of an application to ensure elements like buttons, menus, and forms work as expected.

* System Testing:
Testing the entire application as a complete system to validate its compliance with specified requirements.

* ReTesting:
Testing specific test cases that previously failed to verify if the issue has been fixed.

* Adhoc Testing:
Informal testing conducted without a structured plan or test cases, focusing on finding bugs intuitively.

* Web Application Testing:
Testing web-based applications for functionality, compatibility, performance, and security.

* Mobile Application Testing:
Testing mobile apps for functionality, usability, compatibility, and performance on different devices and platforms.

* Interruption Testing:
Testing how an application handles interruptions, like incoming calls, notifications, or loss of network connectivity.

* UAT Testing (User Acceptance Testing):
Testing conducted by end-users to verify if the application meets business needs and is ready for release.

* API Testing:
Testing application programming interfaces (APIs) to ensure they perform as expected in terms of functionality, reliability, and security.

* Contract Testing:
Testing performed to verify that two services (e.g., APIs) can communicate and adhere to the agreed-upon contract.

* Maintenance Testing:
Testing performed after deployment to ensure updates or changes do not negatively impact the application.

* White Box Testing:
Testing the internal logic, structure, and code of the application, usually done by developers.

* Black Box Testing:
Testing the application without knowledge of its internal workings, focusing only on inputs and outputs.

* Grey Box Testing:
A hybrid approach combining elements of white box and black box testing, with partial knowledge of the application's internal structure.

* Verification:
The process of checking whether the product is being built correctly by validating design, specifications, and processes.

* Validation:
The process of checking whether the built product meets the userâ€™s requirements and functions as intended.
