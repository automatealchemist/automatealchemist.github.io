I am **Ujjwal Kumar Singh** a **Software Tester** with experience of 3 years and dedicated to enhancing product quality with a strong emphasis on improving user experience and functionality across both mobile and web applications. My expertise lies in analyzing, testing, and ensuring the reliability of software to meet user expectations. I am driven by a passion for quality and a keen interest in staying updated with the latest tools and trends in the industry to provide optimized, high-quality software solutions.

üå± I am currently working with **Rest Assured for API testing** and using the **BDD framework** to create test scripts that are scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain. This approach helps ensure smooth integration and reliable communication among different software modules.

üíûÔ∏è I have successfully automated end-to-end functionality for multiple web applications using **Selenium** combined with Python, utilizing frameworks like **Pytest and BDD**. This experience has enabled me to build robust automated test suites that streamline repetitive tasks, minimize human error, and boost overall efficiency in the testing process.

‚ö° In addition to my core skills, I have acquired extensive, hands-on experience with several essential tools that form the backbone of my testing strategy. These include:

-**Postman for API testing**, where I design and execute comprehensive API tests to validate endpoints effectively.

-**JIRA** for project management, enabling me to track issues, manage tasks, and facilitate communication within the development team.

-**TestLink and Zephyr Squad** for managing test cases, helping maintain structured test documentation and traceability.

-**Swagger for API documentation**, which assists in verifying API specifications and understanding API behavior in real-time.

-**Git for version control**, supporting efficient code management, collaboration, and rollback capabilities, ensuring consistent software updates.

‚úçÔ∏è I have considerable experience in crafting **QA documents**, from test plans to test cases and defect reports, providing clear insights and actionable feedback to the development team. Additionally, I have integrated various generative AI tools into my QA processes, resulting in improved productivity by automating routine tasks and enhancing data analysis accuracy.
