A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking is one of those books that makes me look at the universe in an entirely new way. Published in 1988, it explores complex topics like the Big Bang, black holes, and the nature of time itself. As someone who doesn’t have a deep background in physics, I was surprised at how approachable Hawking made these difficult subjects. He explains them in clear, simple language, often using everyday examples that helped me grasp even the most challenging concepts.

What really stood out to me was how the book isn’t just a science lesson it is also a philosophical exploration. Hawking doesn’t shy away from asking big, deep questions about the universe, like how it began and where it is heading. He encourages readers to think about our place in all of it, which gave me a lot to reflect on long after I put the book down.

Throughout the book, I appreciated how Hawking didn’t just talk about the science for the sake of it. He made it clear that understanding the universe also means understanding ourselves and our role in it. There were moments when he brought up topics like the nature of time and the possibility of a unified theory of everything that made me stop and think about things in a completely different way.

Overall, I found the book to be a fascinating mix of science and philosophy. It’s not just about facts or theories; it’s about sparking curiosity and encouraging readers to look at the universe with a sense of awe and wonder. Even though it dives deep into complex topics, it’s a book that kept me engaged and thinking long after I finished it.
